    <main><h2> Phenomenal Woman</h2></main>
<body>
    <p>By: Maya Angelou</p>
    <p>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.<br>
        I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size<br>
        But when I start to tell them,<br>
        They think I'm telling lies.<br>
        I say,<br>
        It's in the reach of my arms<br>
        The span of my hips,<br>
        The stride of my step,<br>
        The curl of my lips.<br>
        I'm a woman<br>
        Phenomenally.<br>
        Phenomenal woman,<br>
        That's me.<br></p>
        
        <p>I walk into a room<br>
        Just as cool as you please,<br>
        And to a man,<br>
        The fellows stand or<br>
        Fall down on their knees.<br>
        Then they swarm around me,<br>
        A hive of honey bees.<br>
        I say,<br>
        <b>It's the fire in my eyes,<br>
        And the flash of my teeth,<br>
        The swing in my waist,<br>
        And the joy in my feet.<br></b> <!--I found this text important because it conveys that although she does not fit into society eyes physically she offers so much more. It is the desire in her eyes, the warmth in her smile, how she walks with so much confidence and pep in her step. -->
        I'm a woman<br>
        Phenomenally.<br>
        Phenomenal woman,<br>
        That's me.<br></p>
        
        <p>Men themselves have wondered<br>
        What they see in me.<br>
        They try so much<br>
        But they can't touch<br>
        My inner mystery.<br>
        When I try to show them<br>
        They say they still can't see.<br>
        I say,<br>
        It's in the arch of my back,<br>
        The sun of my smile,<br>
        The ride of my breasts,<br>
        The grace of my style.<br>
        I'm a woman<br></p>

        <p>Phenomenally.<br>
        Phenomenal woman,<br>
        That's me.<br></p>
        
        <p>Now you understand<br>
        Just why my head's not bowed.<br>
        I don't shout or jump about
        Or have to talk real loud.<br>
        When you see me passing
        It ought to make you proud.<br>
        I say,<br>
        It's in the click of my heels,<br>
        The bend of my hair,<br>
        the palm of my hand,<br>
        The need of my care,<br>
        'Cause I'm a woman<br>
        Phenomenally.<br>
        Phenomenal woman,<br>
        That's me.<br></p>
